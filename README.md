# Arbitrage Cross Exchanges

This program finds a difference of several percent on different crypto exchanges and sends all the information to telegram.

# Features

- Currently 5 working exchanges
- You can configure the price difference between exchanges and the timeout between requests
- Found pairs are sent to you in telegram
- It is possible to add more exchanges
- You can also add bad coins that have a different blockchain or smart contract on two exchanges to the bad_bases.json file to avoid inconsistencies between exchanges

# Usage

1) Install all packages
2) Add your exchanges's API and Telegram Token and your telegram id
3) python3 main.py
4) SWAG

# P.S.

There are many more things that can be added to this program to stabilize the work, but at the moment I do not have time to update it
